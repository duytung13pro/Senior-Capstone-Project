Project Description

1. Problem Statement

In the modern educational landscape, educators often face significant administrative burdens that detract from their primary goal: teaching. Managing course materials, communicating effectively with parents and students, and organizing weekly schedules can become overwhelming without a centralized system. Simultaneously, students require a streamlined, accessible interface to engage with learning materials without technical friction. Existing solutions often lack specific productivity tools for teachers or are too complex for rapid adoption.

2. Project Focus

The project focuses on four key areas to address these problems:

Course & Module Management: Teachers can create, update, and organize courses and learning modules. Each module can contain files and videos, tailored to different languages and educational levels.

Authentication & Role Management: The platform supports secure login and registration for users, including social login via Google. Users are assigned roles (such as teacher or student), with permissions and access tailored to their role.

Teacher Productivity Tools: The frontend provides templates for communication (such as emails to parents and class announcements) and weekly planning, helping educators save time and stay organized.

Student Resources: Components and tools are provided for students to easily access learning materials and resources.

3. Technology Stack

The project uses React/Next.js (TypeScript) for the frontend and Python/Django for the backend, ensuring scalability and maintainability while remaining programmer-friendly.

4. Member Roles

Jay (Front End & UX Development): Develops user-facing features, ensures a responsive design, and leads the user experience (UX) research and design efforts.

Quoc (Backend & API): Designs and implements the core server-side logic, database schema, and API endpoints.

Khai (Integration & Devops): Manages the CI/CD pipeline, ensures seamless integration between the frontend and backend, and handles deployment.

5. Project Summary

The project’s primary focus is to enable classroom management for teachers and enhance learning for students by providing tools for course administration, communication, scheduling, and secure access.
