The system is designed to support Teachers who need to easily create and organize courses and learning modules to provide a structured, logical environment for their students; they also require access to communication templates for announcements and emails to save administrative time. Students need to securely log in using their Google accounts to quickly access materials without managing new credentials, and they must be able to access learning modules containing embedded videos and files to review content at their own pace. Finally, Administrators require the ability to assign specific roles (Teacher, Student) to new users upon registration to strictly control access permissions and maintain platform security.
