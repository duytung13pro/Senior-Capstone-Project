Project Abstract

We developed an AI-assisted Learning Management System to streamline course administration and communication. Built on React/Next.js and Python/Django, the platform features secure Google auth, role-based access, and organized learning modules. It empowers teachers with productivity tools while providing students seamless access to educational resources in a scalable environment.
