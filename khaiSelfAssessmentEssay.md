My senior design project, TtranPphu/little-startup, is an instructional platform that seeks to assist teachers and students by streamlining classroom management and enhancing learning experiences. From an intellectual perspective, the project allows me to integrate frontend and backend knowledge into one practical application. The site is focused on managing course and modules, where teachers can create, organize, and distribute learning materials, with the added advantage of providing students easy access to study materials. Features like authentication, role management, and teacher productivity features display a full-stack approach by utilizing both React/Next.js with TypeScript for the client-side and Java/Spring Boot for the server-side. This project aligns with my goal of developing software with real, practical relevance to the education industry. By making a contribution to this site, I wish to further my web development, user experience, and system design skills by collaborating as part of a team. The project is an integration of technical application of skill and problem-solving wherein I have cultivated throughout my academic studies. 

My studies at the college have provided me with a firm foundation on which to build this project. Courses such as CS301 – Data Structures and Algorithms and CS350 – Software Engineering have educated me on the fundamentals of producing good, maintainable code and development within a structured software life cycle. Additionally, subjects like CS410 – Web Application Development and CS420 – Database Systems have prepared me to manage modern frontend frameworks, backend architectures, and relational databases, which all belong to this platform. Other than technical expertise, my learning in CS430 – Human-Computer Interaction has prepared me to consider usability and user experience, such that the platform becomes usable for both students and instructors. Together, these courses provide a balance of theoretical knowledge and practical application skills, and I am equipped to make good decisions in both system architecture and interface design. I anticipate directly applying these principles in creating modular course management, secure authentication, and interactive learning tools for the project. 

My co-op experiences have also shaped my skills in making useful contributions to the project. By working at Honeywell Intelligrated as a Software Engineering Intern, I gained hands-on experience in programming complex software systems and collaborating with cross-functional teams. I undertook activities like automation, debugging, and integration testing that improved my problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills. I also gained the skill to handle timelines and note work tidily, which is essential in coordinating a multi-component project like our learning platform. Technical skills such as API development, version control mechanisms such as Git, and familiarity with deployment in the cloud have been solidified through my co-op. These lessons learned will guide my approach to designing scalable backend systems, combining frontend components, and making the platform maintainable and fault-tolerant. My co-op has largely connected the classroom with the real world, and that will be most important to this project's success.

I am highly enthusiastic about participating in this project since it combines my love for software development with a meaningful application towards education. I individually hope to create instruments that automate teaching and enhance learning availability, and it is well aligned with the platform's goals. The ability to impact both educators and students through technology is inspiring and drives my commitment to producing quality work. I am particularly excited about integrating features like teacher productivity templates, secure authentication, and multilingual learning modules. This project allows me to apply my technical skills while exercising creativity in designing interfaces and system workflows that meet user needs. Additionally, the collaborative aspect of the project excites me, as it offers an opportunity to learn from teammates and contribute my strengths in frontend and backend development. My fascination is fueled both by technical sophistication and potential practical application of the project.

My first approach to designing the platform is an incremental, modular development plan. I would start with establishing critical backend services like authentication, role management, and course module APIs, then proceed with front-end implementation using React/Next.js components. I shall employ Agile practices to rank tasks, track progress, and repeat on features according to feedback from the team. Deliverables will be a fully functional platform that allows teachers to manage courses and communicate efficiently, and students to navigate resources without obstruction. I shall conduct self-assessment of my work by establishing clear milestones and testing for functionality according to project requirements so that each segment fulfills technical and user experience requirements. The success measure will be the completeness, usability, and stability of the platform, as well as my own cognitive ability to contribute to the team and gain knowledge through the collaborative process. It is a formal
